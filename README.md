# Football Analysis

This repository contains a demo notebook for enriching match data with probabilities and expected points.

## Contents
- `notebooks/enriching_match_data.ipynb`: Notebook demonstrating how to calculate probabilities and expected points from a sample dataset.
- `data/matches.csv`: Example data used in the notebook.

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Load `matches.csv`.
3. Run the function `add_probabilities(df)` to generate probabilities and expected points.
4. Inspect the results with `df.head()`.

## Next steps
The notebook is intended as a demo. Integration with Power BI and more advanced analysis will be added later.
